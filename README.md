# Readable hashes

This crate is a work-in-progress. I plan to get it working and clean up the documentation before releasing a blog post. Stay tuned.

Goals:
- Add documentation
- Add tests
- See if the wordlist could be laid out more efficiently in memory
- Clean up wordlist a bit more - strip out some unwanted URLs, punctuation
